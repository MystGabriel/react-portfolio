## ðŸ’» How it works

Made to show off my skills and demonstrate all my knowledge. Good design with smooth animations for better navigation. 

## ðŸš€ How it was made

#### React.js
> I'm learning more about frontend engines and React show me how powerful it is.

#### AOS Library React
> The animations were made with the Animate On Scroll library. An intuitive and super easy to use tool.

#### Figma
> Figma was used to make the layout, where all the colors and fonts of the application were taken.

#### CSS Animation
> The logo was made with a special font and was animated with pure CSS.

#### StaticForms API
> The form is fully functional. An external API hosted by StaticForms was used.

#### Swiper.js Library
> The carousel used in the portfolio section was built using the Swiper.js library which is a great tool for this purpose.

#### JSON
> This tool was used to store my projects dynamically, where I can organize everything more easily.

#### Google Maps
> There is also the embedded google map.
